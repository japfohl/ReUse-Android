#Corvallis ReUse

## Project History
In early 2010, the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition created the Corvallis-Area ReUse Directory. The purpose of the Corvallis Reuse and Repair Directory, (Corvallis ReUse), is to provide Corvallis and the outlying community a way to easily locate organizations that will take items for repair, reusable items that can be sold to the public as used items, and items to recycle. You can <a href="http://sustainablecorvallis.org/action-teams/waste-prevention/corvallis-area-reuse-directory">download the current directory</a> from the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition website.

## Corvallis ReUse
The Corvallis ReUse app was created to serve as a user-friendly alternative to the PDF directory. Working with Oregon State University students, the Corvallis Sustainability Coalition has released the directory as an Android app. You can now <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=crrd.crrd">download this app through Google Play</a>.
